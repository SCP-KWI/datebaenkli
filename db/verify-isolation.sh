# Datebänkli — end-to-end check of the isolation model against a REAL Postgres.
#
# The unit suite (app/test) runs migrations in PGlite, which is single-user and
# therefore cannot execute a single GRANT. This script covers what it cannot:
# roles, grants, cross-student isolation, timeouts, reset and deprovisioning.
# Run it after any change to provisioning.
#
#   DBK_APP_DB_PASSWORD=... ./db/verify-isolation.sh
#   DBK_PGHOST=127.0.0.1 DBK_PGPORT=55432 DBK_APP_DB_PASSWORD=... ./db/verify-isolation.sh
#
# ## This script CREATES AND DROPS REAL ROLES. Two things stop that being
# ## dangerous, and both are here because it once was.
#
# It used to say "and once against the live server", and HANDOFF §4tt is why
# that line is gone. Its fixtures used to be `u_k3a_muster_lena`,
# `u_k3a_meier_tim` and `t_schaffner` — and `t_schaffner` is exactly what
# /roster names a teacher account for an author called Schaffner, so on the
# deployed cluster it was a real person. The teardown does `DROP OWNED BY
# CURRENT_USER CASCADE` before `DROP ROLE`, so following that instruction would
# have deleted that teacher and every table in their schema.
#
# 1. **The fixtures now live outside the namespace the app can generate.** Every
#    name /roster produces starts `u_` or `t_` (`db/ident.ts`'s ROLE_NAME), so a
#    `vfy_` prefix cannot collide with a real account by construction. That is
#    the fix; the guard below is the belt to its braces.
#
# 2. **The guard asks anyway**, before creating anything: does any fixture name
#    belong to a real account in the meta database? It fails closed — an
#    unreachable meta database is a refusal, not a shrug. With `vfy_` names it
#    should now never fire, which is the point: it is a tripwire for whoever
#    adds a fixture back inside the app's namespace.
#
# The live suites in app/test keep the realistic names deliberately. They are
# never pointed at production — that was always this script's exposure, not
# theirs — `test/support/live-pg.mjs` asserts their roles are gone afterwards,
# and names that look like a real class are what make those tests readable.

# `pg_roles` cannot answer this — a fixture role and a teacher's role are the

# database is what distinguishes them: the app writes a row there for every
# account it creates, and this script writes none.
#
# `to_regclass` rather than assuming the table: a freshly bootstrapped cluster
# has the database but no migrations until the app has run once, and "no
# app_user table" genuinely means "no accounts", not an error.
#
# **`deleted` is excluded, and it is the only state that may be.** Deletion
# deprovisions — the app drops the role and the schema and keeps the row as a
# tombstone, so the *name* is genuinely free again and blocking on it would make
# this script unrunnable on any cluster where such an account once existed
# (which is exactly what the dev cluster looked like after 7.2's own fixtures
# were cleaned up). The other three all keep the role: `active` obviously,
# `archived` as NOLOGIN, and `cold` as NOLOGIN with the schema dumped away —
# for that last one the role *is* the account, so dropping it would strand a
# term's work in an archive nobody can restore against.
