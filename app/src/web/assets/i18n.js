/**
 * The translation layer — phase 6b.
 *
 * German is the default and English is a first-class locale, not a fallback for
 * individuals: the school has immersion classes taught entirely in English, so a
 * whole class works in `en` for a term. That is what makes the missing-key
 * behaviour below worth thinking about rather than asserting.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **German is statically imported; English is fetched only when asked for.**
 * Lookup runs `en -> de -> the key itself`. Three consequences, all deliberate:
 *
 *   - A key that exists in `de` but not yet in `en` renders *in German* rather
 *     than as `roster.students.none`. A half-swept catalogue degrades to a
 *     bilingual page, which is ugly but readable; the alternative degrades to
 *     debug output in front of a class.
 *   - A key missing from *both* renders as the key. Loud on purpose — a silent
 *     empty string is how a label disappears for a term without anyone filing it.
 *   - `t()` called before `load()` resolves returns German, because the German
 *     catalogue is already there. Pages ship with German in the markup and swap
 *     after `/api/me`, so this is the same string either way.
 *
 * **`localStorage["chalk-lang"]` is a cache, and the server always wins.**
 * Phase 6b left this out because there was no `chalk-theme` convention for it to
 * match; phase 7 built one, which made the question it was deferred over —
 * "which side wins after a switch on a second device?" — finally answerable.
 *
 * The answer is that the question was the wrong shape. There are not two sides.
 * `app_user.locale` is the source of truth and this key is a **paint-ahead
 * cache**: `paintCached()` reads it to choose the language for the first frame,
 * and the moment `/api/me` answers, that response overwrites both the DOM and
 * the key. So a student who switched to English in the classroom and opens the
 * app on a laptop that has never seen them gets one frame of German and then
 * English — strictly better than before, when they got German until `/api/me`
 * returned, and with no new authority anywhere.
 *
 * This is the opposite of `chalk-theme`, which `util.js` documents from its
 * side: the theme is device-local so `localStorage` *is* authoritative there.
 * Two keys, adjacent, deliberately asymmetric.
 *
 * `/login` is the one page where this key genuinely decides, because there is no
 * account yet to ask. It is also the only place a stale value can survive a
 * whole page view, which is a good trade for a login form in the last language
 * this browser used.
 *
 * **Substitution values are plain text, never markup.** `t()` does not escape —
 * the caller does, because the caller knows whether it is writing to
 * `textContent` (no escaping, and `esc()` there would render a literal `&amp;`)
 * or building HTML. Backticks in a catalogue string mark an identifier and the
 * page turns them into `<code>` *after* escaping; see `sql.js`'s `ticked()` for
 * why that order is the whole safety argument.
