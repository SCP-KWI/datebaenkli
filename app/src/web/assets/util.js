 * that forgets its content type is a silent 415 that looks like a dead button.
 * `wireThemeToggle` joined them in phase 7 for the same reason: six pages, one
 * button, and a copy that forgets to write `localStorage` is a toggle that works
 * until you navigate.
 *
 * `ticked` and `mb` joined them in 7.2, and both are here for that same test —
 * not "this is used twice", but "the second copy can be wrong without anyone
 * seeing it". Each says which way at its own definition.

/**
 * The light/dark toggle. `theme.js` applies the stored choice before first
 * paint; this is the only thing that writes it.
 *
 * **The theme is device-local and `localStorage` is its source of truth** — the
 * opposite of the language, which lives in `app_user.locale` and treats its
 * `chalk-lang` key as a cache (`i18n.js`). The two keys sit side by side and
 * look like siblings, so the difference is worth stating: a teacher who wants
 * dark on the classroom projector and light on their laptop is expressing a
 * preference *about that screen*, and syncing it to the account would be a bug.
 * A student switching to English is expressing something about themselves, and
 * not syncing that would be the bug.
 *
 * The icon is the *target* state, not the current one — `dark_mode` while light,
 * per Chalk §6. The label has to say the same thing.
 *
 * **This function is the only owner of that `aria-label`, and the button must
 * not carry a `data-i18n-attr` for it.** Both together is a bug that testing in
 * light mode cannot find: `apply()` writes whatever constant key the markup
 * names, it runs *after* this wiring on every page, and so a reader in dark mode
 * got the icon for "switch to light" beside the label "switch to dark". The two
 * only agree in the mode the author happened to be in.
 *
 * **`labelFor` is a callback, not two strings**, and that is not ceremony: pages
 * wire this once against the cached locale and then load the authoritative one
 * from `/api/me` a moment later. Captured strings would be from the first of
 * those and would survive the second, so a student who switched to English would
 * flip the toggle and get a German label. Calling `t` late reads the live
 * binding that `load()` swaps.
 *
 * **Returns its paint function**, which the page must call again once that
 * authoritative locale has landed — wiring early is what makes the button live
 * during the `/api/me` round trip, and re-painting is what stops the label being
 * stuck in the cached language when the two disagree.
