 * The student page.
 *
 * Plain ES modules, served as-is — only `editor.js` is bundled, and only
 * because CodeMirror cannot be served any other way. Everything here is the
 * client half of the contract in docs/API.md "Running SQL": a failed query is a
 * `200` carrying `{ ok: false, error }`, a successful one carries one entry per
 * statement, and `rowCount` is the *true* total even when `rows` was clipped.
 *
 * The one thing worth knowing before editing this file: a script is sent to
 * Postgres as a single simple-protocol message, which means the server wraps it
 * in one implicit transaction. A failure in the third statement therefore takes
 * the first two with it. `MULTI_STATEMENT_ROLLBACK` below says so out loud,
 * because the opposite assumption — "the first two committed" — is the natural
 * one and would have students hunting for rows that were never there.

 * §8a). The raw text stays, in full and unaltered: it is what a student will
 * find if they paste the error into a search engine, and it is the only part
 * that is certainly true. The hint is the app's reading of it, and `hintFor`
 * returns null rather than guess.
 *
 * The raw message stays English in both locales, and that is not an oversight —
 * it is Postgres's own words, and the searchability is the whole reason it is
 * there. The hint above it is the part that speaks the student's language. An
 * English-locale student still gets one, because `42803` is restated by its
 * error message rather than explained by it.
 *
 * The `.hint-de` class name is now a misnomer — it is the hint in whatever
 * locale is active. Left alone deliberately: `sql.html`'s stylesheet keys the
 * adjacent-sibling rule `.hint-de + .msg` off it (§4ll), and renaming a class
 * to fix a comment is how a CSS rule silently stops applying.
