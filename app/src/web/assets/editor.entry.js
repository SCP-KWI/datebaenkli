 * cannot be served straight to a browser the way `sql.js` and the HTML pages
 * are. Everything CodeMirror-shaped is therefore confined to this file, behind
 * one plain function; `sql.js` imports `createEditor` and knows nothing else
 * about the library. If CodeMirror is ever swapped out, this is the file to

 *
 * The build output is `dist/web/assets/editor.js`. It is a build artefact, not
 * a vendored blob — nothing minified is committed to a public repository.
