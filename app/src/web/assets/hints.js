/**
 * Explanations for Postgres errors — the SQLSTATE hint layer, phases 6a and 6b.
 *
 * A beginner who writes `SELECT * FROM kunde` gets
 * `ERROR: relation "kunde" does not exist` — English, and phrased for someone
 * who already knows what a relation is. This module turns that into one
 * sentence in the student's own language and, where it safely can, names the
 * table they probably meant.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE §8a calls this one of the highest-value teaching features in the
 * app, and the reason is that the alternative was rejected: Postgres *can*
 * localise its own messages via `lc_messages`, but the alpine image ships no
 * German locale and the translations are uneven. A hint layer of our own is
 * also the only version that can mention *this student's* tables.
 *
 * **An English-locale student still wants the hints.** Postgres speaks English
 * and they can read it, but `42803` is not *explained* by `column … must appear
 * in the GROUP BY clause` — it is restated by it. The hint earns its place in
 * both locales, which is what 6b below is for.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **6a fused the analysis with the phrasing; 6b separated them.** Each handler
 * used to return a finished German sentence. It now returns a *key* and its
 * substitutions — `{ key: 'hint.table.unknown', vars: { table }, suggestion }` —
 * and the phrasing lives in `i18n-de.js` / `i18n-en.js` beside every other
 * string. `renderHint()` puts the two back together.
 *
 * The alternative — a second set of twenty handlers returning English — was
 * rejected explicitly. *Which* message shape matched and *which* catalog object
 * is the near miss are locale-independent; only the sentence is not. Forking
 * would have doubled the branching, and the branching is the part that was hard
 * to get right (HANDOFF §4jj). One bug fixed once, in one place, is the whole
 * point.
 *
 * **Pure, and that is the point.** No DOM, no fetch, and the only import is the
 * `t` the caller hands to `renderHint`. Same argument as `names.js`: it is the
 * part of the page a test can reach, and it is the part that can be quietly
 * wrong for months. `test/hints.test.mjs` drives it.
 *
 * **Every message pattern here was read off a real server, not remembered.**
 * That was not pedantry — three of them are not what they look like:
 *
 *   - `SELECT * FROM demoo.kantone` is **42P01** `relation "demoo.kantone"
 *     does not exist`, not 3F000 and not a bare table name. The schema is
 *     *inside* the quotes.
 *   - 42703 has three shapes, one of which is unquoted:
 *     `column "x" does not exist`, `column "x" of relation "y" does not exist`,
 *     and `column k.x does not exist` for an alias-qualified reference.
 *   - 42P01 also covers `missing FROM-clause entry for table "x"`, which is a
 *     completely different mistake from a misspelled table and deserves its own
 *     sentence.
 *
 * If you add a code, get its message from a server first. `psql` and a
 * `GET STACKED DIAGNOSTICS` loop took ten minutes and corrected four guesses.
 *
 * **Swiss German orthography: no ß, ever.** `gross`, `heisst`, `schliessen`.
 * This is a Swiss school and the rest of the app follows the same rule. It
 * applies to `i18n-de.js`, which is now where the sentences are.
 *
 * **Backticks mark identifiers**, and the caller turns them into `<code>` after
 * escaping — never before, or a table named `<script>` becomes one. The
 * backticks now live in the catalogue templates, which is the right place: where
 * a name is shown as code is a phrasing decision. What does *not* live there is
 * the safety strip — every substitution value goes through `plain()` on its way
 * out of a handler, so a table whose name contains a backtick cannot unbalance
 * the caller's pairs. A translator cannot forget that, because a translator
 * never touches it.
