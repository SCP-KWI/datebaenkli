  /**
   * Repair whatever the last run left behind — **after the port is bound, and
   * that ordering is the whole point.**
   *
   * It fixes accounts created while the teaching database was unreachable, a
   * deletion whose archive dump failed, a grant that never landed. Non-fatal on
   * purpose: a provisioning problem must not stop the app serving, because
   * `/health`, the login page and every teacher's roster work without it, and
   * refusing to boot would turn a partial outage into a total one.
   *
   * It used to run *before* `listen`, which quietly made that promise
   * conditional. Since 5b the pass can shell out to `pg_restore`, up to
   * `DBK_DUMP_TIMEOUT_MS` (300 s) per account and sequentially, so three
   * accounts needing a restore is fifteen minutes before the port opens — long
   * enough for the container's health check to fail, be killed, and start over
   * from the top, restoring the same three accounts again. A crash loop whose
   * cause reads as a broken image.
   *
   * Phase 7.3 is what made this worth fixing rather than noting: cold storage now
   * has a button, so reaching the state that needs a restore no longer takes
   * `curl`.
   *
   * **The fix is the order, not a shorter timeout.** A dump that gets cut off
   * half way is worse than one that takes five minutes; the repair is simply
   * not more urgent than serving. Still `await`ed, so failures land in the log
   * in order and "serving anyway" is now literally true rather than aspirational
   * — nothing is waiting on this promise, `listen` has already resolved.
   *
   * **What this does newly allow is a request landing mid-reconcile**, which was
   * impossible when the pass finished before the port opened, so it is worth
   * saying why it is acceptable rather than leaving it to be rediscovered. Both
   * sides do their DDL as `dbk_app`, and Postgres serialises DDL on the same
   * objects with locks, so the failure mode is one of them erroring rather than
   * two half-applied changes. Provisioning is idempotent — `provision.live.test.mjs`
   * pins re-provisioning an existing account as a no-op — and this pass is
   * non-fatal and runs again on the next boot. So the worst case is a logged
   * error and a repair deferred by one restart, against a crash loop as the
   * alternative.
