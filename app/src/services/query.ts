/**
 * The query runner — phase 3.
 *
 * Takes SQL a student typed, runs it *as that student's Postgres role*, and
 * returns one result per statement. Isolation is not enforced anywhere in this
 * file: the connection is opened as the student (db/pools.ts), so every
 * permission question is answered by Postgres. What this file owns is the
 * things Postgres will not do for us — the wall-clock limit, the row cap, and
 * leaving the pooled connection fit for the next request.
 *
 * ## The simple query protocol, on purpose
 *
 * A lesson wants `SELECT …; SELECT …;` in the editor to produce two grids
 * (ARCHITECTURE §4). That needs the simple protocol, which is what node-postgres
 * uses when a query carries no bind parameters — so the student's SQL is sent
 * as one string and comes back as an array of results. Nothing here interpolates
 * anything into it: the text is the student's, the whole statement, and it is
 * privileged exactly as far as their role is.
 *
 * ## Why the rows are streamed rather than sliced
 *
 * The 1000-row fetch cap cannot be applied after the fact. `SELECT * FROM
 * generate_series(1, 1e9)` would put every row in the Node heap before we ever
 * saw the result, and take the process — and with it everybody else's lesson —
 * down well before any timeout fired. So we attach a `row` listener, which
 * makes node-postgres stop accumulating into the result (`_accumulateRows` in
 * pg/lib/query.js) and hand each row straight to us; we keep the first 1000 and
 * drop the rest.
 *
 * The statement still runs to completion, deliberately. Postgres reports the
 * true row count in the CommandComplete tag, so letting it finish is what turns
 * a truncated grid into an honest "showing the first 1000 of 4,812" instead of
 * a silent lie. Memory is already bounded by then, and the wall clock is bounded
 * by the watchdog.
