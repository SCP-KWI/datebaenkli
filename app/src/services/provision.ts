/**
 * The provisioning engine — phase 2.
 *
 * Everything that makes a row in `app_user` into a real Postgres identity:
 * the login role, the schema it owns, the teacher's read-only grant, the
 * session rails, the reset, the archive dump, the drop.
 *
 * Three properties this file is built around:
 *
 * **It is idempotent.** Every operation is "make the world look like this",
 * not "do this once". `app_user` carries no `provisioned_at` flag on purpose
 * (HANDOFF §7): Postgres is the source of truth for what exists, so a second
 * source that can disagree would be a bug generator. The consequence is that
 * `reconcile.ts` can run the same calls over accounts phase 1 already created,
 * and a run that dies halfway is repaired by the next one.
 *
 * **It never runs in the meta transaction.** Roles and schemas live in the
 * teaching database; accounts live in the meta database. Two databases cannot
 * share a transaction, so callers commit their meta work first and provision
 * afterwards. A crash in between leaves an account with no role — visible, and
 * repaired by the reconciler — rather than a role with no account, which is
 * invisible and holds a schema name hostage forever.
 *
 * **It builds SQL by string.** DDL takes no bind parameters. See db/ident.ts
 * for the allow-list and the quoting that keeps that honest.
 *
 * The SQL sequences come from ARCHITECTURE.md §2, which is verified against a
 * real server by db/verify-isolation.sh. Where this file goes beyond that
 * document, the comment says why.

 * can raise it on their own role and Postgres offers no way to forbid that
 * (ARCHITECTURE.md §3). The watchdog in phase 3 is the actual control.
 *
 * **`work_mem` is USERSET too, and for a long time this comment did not say so
 * — it sorted the other two settings into the right buckets and left the third
 * looking like a limit.** `SET work_mem = '6GB'` escapes it, `hash_mem_multiplier`
 * multiplies it, and it is charged per sort/hash node per parallel worker, so a
 * single statement can ask for many times the number. The control is the
 * `mem_limit` on the db container in docker-compose.yml, not this line; what
 * this line buys is a sane default for students who never think about it.
 *
 * `temp_file_limit` is deliberately absent: it is `SUSET`, so `dbk_app` cannot
 * set it per role at all. It is set cluster-wide in docker-compose.yml, where
 * a student cannot reach it. Note it caps spill to disk only — it is not a
 * second line of defence for the above.
 *
 * **`search_path` is the odd one out and does not belong to that argument at
 * all.** The other three are rails a student can step over and the comment
 * above is about how little they are worth; this one is not a limit in any
 * sense, it is the reason `SELECT * FROM kantone` works without a schema name.
 * A student overriding it hurts nobody, including themselves — `RESET ALL`
 * puts them back on `"$user", public`, which is where everyone was before 0.14,
 * and the reconciler restores it on the next pass either way.
 *
 * Set here as a role default rather than per connection, and that is what makes
 * `query.ts`'s unconditional `RESET search_path` keep working: `RESET` restores
 * the *role* default, so a connection handed back after an exercise lands on
 * the playground path rather than on Postgres's compiled-in one. Setting it per
 * session instead would have meant either a round trip on every playground
 * query or a `RESET` that silently undid it.

     * fails, and the way it fails is §4a in its fifth disguise. `dbk_app`
     * creates the schema, the dump's next statement hands ownership to the
     * student, and from that moment `dbk_app` — which holds the student's role
     * NOINHERIT — has no `CREATE` on the schema it just gave away. The very next
     * `CREATE TABLE` is `permission denied for schema u_…`. Whenever `dbk_app`
     * acts *on* a student's objects, check which of the two it is acting as.
     *
     * So the restore runs `--role`, like the dump. That costs one thing: a
     * student role is `NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE` and never holds `CREATE ON
     * DATABASE` — `ensureRole` creates their schema *for* them with
     * `CREATE SCHEMA ... AUTHORIZATION` — so `SET ROLE u_x` cannot execute the
     * dump's `CREATE SCHEMA` either. Hence the shape below: `ensureStudent`
     * makes the schema first, and the dump's own schema entry is filtered out of
     * the restore through a table-of-contents list file. Granting the student
     * `CREATE ON DATABASE` for the duration was the alternative and was
     * rejected: it opens a window in which a student can own a second schema,
     * and a crash mid-restore leaves that window open with nothing watching it.
     *
     * `--no-owner` then costs nothing and removes a class of failure: with
     * `--role` every object is created *by* the student, so ownership is right
     * by construction and no `ALTER ... OWNER` statement has to succeed.
     *
     * **`--no-privileges` is deliberate.** A year-old dump carries the GRANTs
     * the schema had when it was cooled, including USAGE to a teacher who may no
     * longer teach this student. The roster is the source of truth for who may
     * read a schema, so the ACLs are dropped and the second `ensureStudent`
     * below applies the current ones. Without it, restoring an account would
     * silently re-grant a former teacher access until the next reconcile pass.
     *
     * **The verification is the point of the method** (§4dd). `pg_restore`
     * exiting 0 proves statements ran, not that the student who owns the tables
     * can read them — that gap is exactly what let a restored cluster report
     * success over a class that could not connect. So the tables are counted
     * three ways that can only agree if everything worked: from the dump's own
     * table of contents, from `pg_class` as `dbk_app`, and from
     * `information_schema.tables` over a connection opened **as the student**,
