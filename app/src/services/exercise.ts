/**
 * Exercises — phase 9.
 *
 * A teacher builds a set of tables and a task, hands it to a class, and every
 * student gets their own copy to work in and their own way to hand something
 * back.
 *
 * ## Where a student's copy lives
 *
 * In its own schema, owned by that student: `x7_u_k3a_muster_lena`. Not
 * prefixed tables inside their playground schema, and the difference is what
 * makes three of the four requirements fall out of the design rather than be
 * implemented:
 *
 *   - **isolation** is the same Postgres-enforced thing as everywhere else, not
 *     a new rule written here — the schema has an owner and nobody else has
 *     USAGE on it;
 *   - **"reset just this exercise"** is `DROP SCHEMA`, exact by construction,
 *     rather than a prefix match over table names that a student can break by
 *     renaming a table;
 *   - **the schema browser shows it** with no change at all, because
 *     `services/catalog.ts` lists what the caller can read and this is theirs.
 *
 * The name is allocated once and stored (`exercise_workspace`), never derived at
 * the call site — see that table's comment in `meta/003_exercises.sql` for why a
 * derived-and-clamped name is an isolation bug rather than a cosmetic one.
 *
 * ## This file builds no SQL by string
 *
 * CLAUDE.md reserves that for `provision.ts` and `import.ts`, and phase 9 adds
 * no third. Everything here that would need it is delegated:
 *
 *   - the schema itself (`CREATE SCHEMA … AUTHORIZATION`, the drop, the
 *     teacher's read grant) runs as `dbk_app`, which is `provision.ts`'s hazard
 *     class, so it lives there as `createWorkspace` / `dropWorkspace`;
 *   - a CSV fixture becomes a table through `import.ts`'s `createAndFill`, which
 *     is where the `CREATE TABLE` and the parameterised `INSERT` already live.
 *
 * What is left is the teacher's own SQL, executed verbatim on a connection
 * opened *as the student*. Nothing is interpolated into it — it is the string
 * the teacher typed, run with the privileges of the person it is being run for.
 *
 * ## Why a CSV source is stored as CSV
 *
 * The obvious alternative is to generate `CREATE TABLE` + `INSERT` text when the
 * teacher uploads, store that, and replay it. It was rejected because generating
 * `INSERT INTO kunden VALUES ('Müller', …)` means building *data* by string
 * concatenation from a file nobody has validated — precisely what `import.ts`'s
 * header refuses to do. Keeping the CSV means the values reach Postgres as `$n`
 * parameters on every replay, and it means the teacher can still see the file
 * they uploaded rather than a wall of generated SQL.
 *
 * ## Materialisation is lazy
 *
 * A workspace is built when the student first opens the exercise, not for all 25
 * of them when the teacher presses "distribute". Three reasons, in order of how
 * much they cost to get wrong: a student enrolled in week six gets one too; a
 * failure is one student's, visible to them, and retried by clicking again
 * rather than leaving a fan-out half done with nothing watching it; and a
 * workspace lost to "wipe my whole database" comes back by itself, because the
 * absence of the schema *is* the trigger.

 * hand-writing the format — CRC32 and all — for a file a teacher opens once,
 * reads top to bottom and greps. A single annotated script is better at the job
 * anyway, and `renderSubmission` below produces exactly one entry of it, so a
 * single download and a bulk download cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Timestamps are ISO 8601 with the `Z`. Not a `de-CH` rendering, because the
 * container runs UTC and the dev machine does not (HANDOFF §4gg), so a
 * locale-formatted time in a *file* would be the one artefact whose meaning
