/**
 * What the schema browser shows — phase 3.
 *
 * The same principle as the query runner: this reads the catalog over a
 * connection opened *as the student*, so the answer to "what may I see" comes
 * from Postgres rather than from a filter written here. That is why the
 * `has_schema_privilege` / `has_table_privilege` calls in `CATALOG_QUERY` are
 * load-bearing rather than decorative — `pg_class` and `pg_namespace` are
 * world-readable, so without them the browser would hand every student a list
 * of every other student's tables, which is a class roster.
 *
 * ## Why not just run the catalog query through /api/query
 *
 * The page could ask for this SQL the same way it asks for anything else, and
 * for a while that looked like the tidy answer — no new route, and provably the
 * student's own privileges. Two things killed it. `query_log` is the teacher's
 * live lesson view (phase 4), and a `pg_class` join arriving every time a
 * student expands a tree node is noise in it. And refreshing the tree while a
 * long query is running
 * would answer `429 too_many_queries` (the pool is 2 per student) — a browser
 * pane that stops working precisely when the Cancel button next to it becomes
 * interesting.
