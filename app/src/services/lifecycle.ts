/**
 * The nightly `active -> archived` sweep — phase 5b, architecture §8b.
 *
 * **Why this is in the app process and not in the host crontab beside
 * `db/backup.sh`.** It is application semantics from end to end: the
 * `user_state` machine, `destroyUserSessions`, the `audit_log` contract, the
 * teacher grants that `setUserState` puts back on the way out. A bash job would
 * have to reimplement `setUserState` in SQL against the meta database and would
 * own a second, silently diverging copy of what archiving means — and since
 * there is no node on the server (HANDOFF §7) it would end up as
 * `docker exec … node` regardless, which is this code with an extra scheduling
 * surface. `backup.sh` is outside the app on purpose, because it must work when
 * the app is broken (§4y); this is the exact opposite requirement.
 *
 * What makes that safe is that the scheduled half is **non-destructive**.
 * Archiving takes a login away and leaves every table where it was, and one
 * click puts it back. The destructive half of the lifecycle — `cold`, which
 * dumps and drops — is admin-triggered per §8b and has no scheduler at all.
 *
 * **Idle is measured from `coalesce(last_active_at, created_at)`.**
 * `last_active_at` is written on login and by the query runner, deliberately
 * not on every request (`auth/session.ts`), so it means "last did something",
 * which is the right notion. It is NULL for an account that has never logged
 * in — a student holding an unused credential slip — and comparing NULL would
 * quietly exclude exactly the accounts a year-old unclaimed slip describes.
 * `created_at` is the honest floor for those.

 * `last_active_at`, so the sweep will not touch them — but a sweep running at
 * 14:00 can read a stale row a second before that login lands, archive the
 * account, and destroy the session they just created. Reversible in a click,
