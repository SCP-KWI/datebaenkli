 * The Postgres role and schema that back them live in the *teaching* database
 * and are created by `provision.ts` — always after that transaction has
 * committed, never inside it, because two databases cannot share one.
 *
 * The account row carries the *intended* identity from the moment it is
 * created: `pg_role`, and a `pg_password_enc` generated up front so
 * provisioning never has to write back here. That is what makes a crashed run
 * repairable — the record of what should exist is complete and durable before
