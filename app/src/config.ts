 * level above both `src/` and `dist/`, so the same relative path works whether
 * this file is being executed from source or from the build. **`builtAt`** is
 * written by `tools/stamp-build.mjs` during `postbuild` and cannot be
 * forgotten.
 *
 * Pairing them is the point: a semver alone went unbumped through seven phases,
 * so it would have named the wrong release with nothing to contradict it. With
 * a timestamp beside it, a stale version is uninformative rather than a lie.
 *
 * **`builtAt: null` means "not a build", and that is a fact rather than a
 * failure.** `npm run dev` runs from `src/` where no `dist/build-info.json`
 * exists, so the footer says so. Both reads are wrapped because neither is
 * worth refusing to boot over — this is the one value in this file whose
 * absence should not crash a container, since nothing depends on it.
