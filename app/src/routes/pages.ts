/**
 * The HTML pages, served from memory.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* @fastify/static: static routes live in an encapsulated
 * plugin scope and carry no route `config`, so serving the pages that way would
 * need the global auth hook exempted by URL prefix — and these pages must be
 * public, which is exactly the exemption that weakens "closed unless marked
 * public". Phase 3's asset tree (`/assets`) is registered with `serve: false`
 * and fronted by one explicit route in server.ts, and that route is `public`
 * too — this comment used to claim the opposite, which §4k reversed: gating a
 * page's *script* leaves the user a dead shell instead of a redirect to
 * `/login`, because the code that would redirect never runs.
 *
 * These pages are unstyled beyond a few lines of CSS. The Chalk pass is phase 7
 * — anything prettier written now would only be thrown away.
 *
 * **They are also byte-for-byte constant, and phase 6b turns on that.** There is
 * no template engine and no substitution of any kind here, so the server cannot
 * render a page in the reader's language. Every page therefore ships with German
 * in its markup and swaps it client-side once `/api/me` answers
 * (`web/assets/i18n.js`). ARCHITECTURE §8a's "server renders the initial page in
 * the stored locale so there's no flash of German" is *not* what happens;
 * getting it would mean introducing templating here, which 6b deliberately did
 * not do for one frame of German. The German left in the markup is also what a
 * reader sees if the script never runs at all, which is §4k one level down.
