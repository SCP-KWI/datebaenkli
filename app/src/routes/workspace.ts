   * The schema browser's tree: every schema, table and column the caller can
   * read — plus what their own schema currently occupies.
   *
   * ## Why the quota is joined on here and not inside the catalog reader
   *
   * The two answers come from opposite ends of the connection story and each
   * service's header is an argument for its own end. `catalog.read` runs **as
   * the student**, because `has_*_privilege` answering for `current_user` is
   * the isolation boundary itself. `quota.usage` runs as **`dbk_app`** against
   * `pg_class`, because asking as the student would report every schema as zero
   * bytes (HANDOFF §4o, and §4q is the near miss). Folding one into the other
   * would put two contradictory-sounding rules in one function.
   *
   * The second reason is not stylistic: `routes/lesson.ts` calls the same
   * `catalog.read` for a teacher's drill-down, where the quota is already
   * rendered from `services/lesson.ts`. Putting it in the reader would measure
   * it twice per drill-down and give one screen two sources for one number.
   *
   * ## A failed measurement costs the number, not the tree
   *
   * `catalog.read` first and on its own: it is what the pane is *for*, and it
   * is the call that raises `not_provisioned` / `user_not_active` when those
   * are the truth. The quota is an extra, so an error measuring it answers
   * `quota: null` and lets the browser render without it — the same bargain
   * `mountVersion` and `hintFor` strike on the client. Logged at `warn`,
   * because a measurement that has started failing is a real thing to know and
   * a silent `null` would be the second way to learn it: from a student
   * suddenly refused a write with no warning line above the tree.
