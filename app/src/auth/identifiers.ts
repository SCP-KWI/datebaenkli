/**
 * Deriving Postgres identifiers from human names — architecture §2.
 *
 * A student's Postgres role name, their schema name and their app login are all
 * the same string. That is deliberate:
 *
 *   - role == schema is what makes `"$user"` at the head of the search_path
 *     resolve to the student's own schema with zero per-session setup;
 *   - login == role means the name a student types to log in is the same name
 *     they will type in `SELECT * FROM u_k3a_muster_lena.kunden`, which is the
 *     whole point of making these readable rather than opaque ids.
 *
 * Everything here is pure. The database only enters when resolving collisions
 * (`allocateIdentifier`), and even that is a single lookup.
