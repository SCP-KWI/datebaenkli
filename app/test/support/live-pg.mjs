/**
 * The plumbing every live suite needs: the connection coordinates, the server
 * probe, the advisory lock, connecting *as* a student, and the teardown that
 * drops the roles a run created.
 *
 * It exists because that plumbing was copy-pasted into five files and one copy
 * of it was wrong. HANDOFF §4u is that run: `query.live.test.mjs` dropped its
 * roles teacher-first, which fails with 2BP01, and the loop swallowed the error
 * with a bare `.catch(() => {})`. A `t_schaffner` role leaked into the
 * *production* teaching database, where `reconcile.ts` cannot see it — reconcile
 * is driven from `app_user`, and a role with no account is invisible to it — so
 * the identifier a real teacher would have been given is gone permanently. The
 * fix landed in one file and was pasted into the others. `dropRoles` below is
 * that fix, once.
 *
 * `support/live-lock.mjs` is the standing precedent: cross-suite live plumbing
 * lives beside the suites, not in each of them.
 *
 * What deliberately stayed in the suites is everything that says *what this
 * suite is about* — its role prefix and password map, its fixture setup, its
 * `after()` hook. Hoisting those would have turned five readable files into
 * five configuration blocks.
