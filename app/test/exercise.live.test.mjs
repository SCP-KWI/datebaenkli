/**
 * Exercise workspaces against a REAL PostgreSQL server — phase 9.
 *
 * `exercise.test.mjs` pins the bookkeeping. This suite exists for the claims
 * that only a real cluster can answer, and every one of them is a claim a mock
 * would have reported as passing while being wrong:
 *
 *   - a student's exercise workspace is **theirs**: the classmate sitting next
 *     to them cannot read it, and neither can they read the classmate's;
 *   - **"reset this exercise" is narrow** — it drops the exercise's tables and
 *     leaves the playground, and every *other* exercise, exactly as they were;
 *   - the teacher can read a workspace and cannot write to it;
 *   - **cold storage takes the workspaces with it.** This is the regression
 *     phase 9 creates if `coldStore`'s sweep is ever removed: it drops the
 *     playground by name, so a workspace would survive — undumped, on the disk
 *     it exists to reclaim, and enough to make a later `DROP ROLE` fail months
 *     afterwards with nothing to explain it.
 *
 * PGlite cannot execute a single `GRANT`, so none of the above is askable there.
 *
 * SKIPPED unless a server is reachable. Bring one up without Docker or sudo:
 *
 *   SP=/tmp/dbk && rm -rf $SP && mkdir -p $SP
 *   initdb -D $SP/data -U postgres --locale=C.UTF-8 --encoding=UTF8 -A trust
 *   pg_ctl -D $SP/data -o "-p 55432 -k /tmp -c listen_addresses=127.0.0.1" -l $SP/pg.log start
 *   PGHOST=127.0.0.1 PGPORT=55432 POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
 *     DBK_APP_DB_PASSWORD=secret bash db/init/00-bootstrap.sh
 *   cd app && npm run build
 *   PGHOST=127.0.0.1 PGPORT=55432 DBK_APP_DB_PASSWORD=secret \
 *     node --test test/exercise.live.test.mjs
