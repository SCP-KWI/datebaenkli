/**
 * The provisioning engine against a REAL PostgreSQL server.
 *
 * `db/verify-isolation.sh` proves that the *SQL sequences* in ARCHITECTURE.md §2
 * work. This proves that `src/services/provision.ts` actually issues them — a
 * different claim, and the one that matters now that the SQL lives in code
 * rather than in a shell script. It drives the compiled provisioner and then
 * checks the result by connecting as the students themselves, because "the
 * teacher can read this table" is only true if a connection as the teacher can
 * read it, not if a GRANT returned without error.
 *
 * SKIPPED unless a server is reachable. Bring one up without Docker or sudo:
 *
 *   SP=/tmp/dbk && rm -rf $SP && mkdir -p $SP
 *   initdb -D $SP/data -U postgres --locale=C.UTF-8 --encoding=UTF8 -A trust
 *   pg_ctl -D $SP/data -o "-p 55432 -k /tmp -c listen_addresses=127.0.0.1" -l $SP/pg.log start
 *   PGHOST=127.0.0.1 PGPORT=55432 POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
