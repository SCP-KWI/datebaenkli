/**
 * The SQLSTATE hint layer (phase 6a's analysis, phase 6b's two locales).
 *
 * Pure logic, no database and no DOM — the `names.test.mjs` precedent, and for
 * the same reason: this is the part of the SQL page a test can reach, and its
 * mistakes are silent. A hint that names the wrong table still renders.
 *
 * **Every `message` and `detail` string below was copied off a real PostgreSQL
 * server**, not composed to fit the regexes. That distinction is the whole
 * value of the file. Four of the shapes are not what they look like:
 * `demoo.kantone` reports 42P01 with the schema *inside* the quotes, 42703 has
 * three different phrasings and only one of them names its table, and 42P01
 * also covers `missing FROM-clause entry`, which is a different mistake
 * entirely. Getting a fresh one: run it in `psql` inside a
 * `GET STACKED DIAGNOSTICS` loop and paste what comes back.
 *
 * **6b split the analysis from the phrasing, and the assertions follow.** A
 * handler now returns a key and its substitutions, so the German assertions
 * below are a test of `i18n-de.js` *and* of the branch that chose the key. Each
 * case is rendered through both catalogues: the German assertions are the
 * detailed ones, carried over from 6a unchanged, and every case additionally
 * asserts that the English renders as English. That second half is what would
 * otherwise rot — nobody reads the English page daily, and a key that silently
 * falls back to German would look fine in a screenshot.
